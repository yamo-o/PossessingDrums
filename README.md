Description
-----------

Possessing Drums is an interface for music instruments for assigning an arbitrary timbre(sound) to an arbitrary object around you(such as a table or cup, or actions such as vocalization by audio signal processing). This code runs on Mac OSX, Linux, and Windows(not tested). This code includes the algorithm for real-time sound source separation, modal parameter estimation, and modal(physical-based) sound synthesis.
